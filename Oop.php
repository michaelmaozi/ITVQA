		$a = array(
			"1" => "oop is Programming paradiam",
			"2" => "completed software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other"

	public function Why oop()
	{
		"1" => "better manageable",
		"2" => "The overall understanding of the software is increased as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users",
		"3" => "Object orientation eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation.   One can easily change the underlying representation by keeping the methods same."
	}

	public function What are main features of OOP()
	{
		"1" => "encapsulation",
		"2" => "polymorphism",
		"3" => "inheritance"
	}

	public function what is encapsulation()
	{
		"1" => "Data hiding: A language feature to restrict access to members of an object. For example, private and protected members in C++.",
		"2" => "Bundling of data and methods together: Data and methods that operate on that data are bundled together."
	}

	public function what is polymorphism and how is supported by java()
	{
		"1" => "Polymorphism means that some code or operations or objects behave differently in different contexts. In C++,  following features support polymorphism."
	}

	public function what are _public _private _protected in object oriented programming()
	{
		"1" => "They are access modifiers and help us implement encapsulation (or information hiding). They tell the compiler which order classes should have access to the field or method being defined",
		"2" => "private - Only the current class will have access to the field or method",
		"3" => "protected - Only the current class and subclasses (and sometimes also same package classes like in Java)"
		"4" => "public - Any class can refer to the field or call the method"
		"5" => "This assumes these keywords are used as part of a field or method declaration within a class definition"
	}

	public function what is Inheritance and what is the purpose ()
	{
		"1" => "The Idea of inheritance is simple, a class is based on another class and uses data and implementation of the other class"
		"2" => "The Purpose of inheritance is Code Reuse"
	}

	public function what is Abstraction()
	{
		"1" => "The first thing with which one is confronted when writing programs is the problem. Typically we are confronted with “real-life” problems and we want to make life easier by providing a program for the problem. However, real-life problems are nebulous and the first thing we have to do is to try to understand the problem to separate necessary from unnecessary details: We try to obtain our own abstract view, or model, of the problem. This process of modeling is called abstraction."
