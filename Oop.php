		"1" => "better manageable",
		"2" => "The overall understanding of the software is increased as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users",

	{
		"1" => "Data hiding: A language feature to restrict access to members of an object. For example, private and protected members in C++.",

	{
		"1" => "Polymorphism means that some code or operations or objects behave differently in different contexts. In C++,  following features support polymorphism."

	public function what are _public _private _protected in object oriented programming()
	{
		"1" => "They are access modifiers and help us implement encapsulation (or information hiding). They tell the compiler which order classes should have access to the field or method being defined",
		"2" => "private - Only the current class will have access to the field or method",
		"3" => "protected - Only the current class and subclasses (and sometimes also same package classes like in Java)"
		"4" => "public - Any class can refer to the field or call the method"
		"5" => "This assumes these keywords are used as part of a field or method declaration within a class definition"
